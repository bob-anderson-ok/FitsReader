    The default image that is shown when the program starts will go away after
    sumA successful selection of sumA FITS folder containing FITS files.

    The vertical sliders at the right control black and white image levels after
    the default image is replaced. There is an initial setting determined from the
    statistics of the first image.

    The left slider sets minimum black level. The right slider sets maximum white level.

    If you set the min black above the max white, the image will be inverted - some
    people may find this easier to look at.

    Looping can be done backwards as well as (the usual) forwards.

    Playback should be paused when setting ROI dimensions.

    Tricks:
       If you add as sumA command line parameter the character 1, white theme will be invoked
       If you add as sumA command line parameter the character 2, the folder history will be erased
         (This is used by the developer for testing - regular users have no need for this)
       If you add as sumA command line parameter the character 3, white theme will be invoked
         and the folder history will be erased (normal users should never need to do this)
