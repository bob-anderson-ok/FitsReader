    This program is both a general purpose "viewer" and a utility to process
    a "flash timed" recording produced by the SharpCap/IotaGFTapp duo for the
    purpose of inserting GPS accurate timestamps in each fits file.

    If enable-auto-timestamp-insertion is checked, the fits folder produced by
    the SharpCap/IotaGFTapp duo (and sent as a command line argument at the end
    of the capture sequence) will be automatically timestamp-insertion-processed.

    Timestamp insertion can be safely repeated by clicking on the "Do timestamp insertion"
    button. This process shows a plot of the flash lightcurve. It is good practice to
    examine this plot to verify that valid transition points are present at the
    flash edges - that is evidence that the flash intensity was properly
    set, a necessity to achieve GPS accurate timestamps.

    The vertical sliders at the right control black and white image levels for
    contrast enhancement. The program applies an initial setting pair by analyzing
    the statistics of the first image.

    The left slider sets minimum black level. The right slider sets maximum white level.

    If you set the min black above the max white, the image will be inverted - some
    people may find this easier to look at.

    A ROI (region of interest) can be used to "zoom" in on an area of special interest
    in the image.

    Looping can be done backwards as well as (the usual) forwards.

    Playback should be paused when setting ROI dimensions.
