    The default image that is shown when the program starts will go away after
    a successful selection of a FITS folder containing FITS files.

    The vertical sliders at the right control black and white image levels.

    The left slider sets minimum black level. The right slider sets maximum white level.

    If you set the min black above the max white, the image will be inverted - some
    people may find this easier to look at.

    NOTE: During playback, occasionally the image flashes white. I don't know what
    causes this, but it is harmless, although upsetting. I will seek to find the cause.
