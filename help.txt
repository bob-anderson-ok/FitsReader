    The vertical sliders at the right control black and white image levels for
    contrast enhancement. The program applies an initial setting pair by analyzing
    the statistics of the first image.

    The left slider sets minimum black level. The right slider sets maximum white level.

    If you set the minF black above the maxF white, the image will be inverted - some
    people may find this easier to look at.

    Looping can be done backwards as well as (the usual) forwards.

    Playback should be paused when setting ROI dimensions.

    Tricks:
       If you add as a command line parameter the character 1, white theme will be invoked
       If you add as a command line parameter the character 2, the folder history will be erased
         (This is used by the developer for testing - regular users have no need for this)
       If you add as a command line parameter the character 3, white theme will be invoked
         and the folder history will be erased (normal users should never need to do this)
